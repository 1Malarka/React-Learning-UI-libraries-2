# Second folder was created to research hooks in react.

The main hooks i was experimenting with, are shown here, such as: [useState, useEffect, useRef, createContext, useContext, useReducer, useCallback, useMemo]

# Needs npm to launch, and node js (? i may forgot if it really necessary)
# npm run dev to launch host

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
