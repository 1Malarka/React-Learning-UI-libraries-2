# React-Learning
Every folder contains information about react, from basics to advanced.

What i learning could be found on that roadmap - site (https://roadmap.sh/react?fl=1)

# Requirements
Download this rar.file https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JKF2VbC_hfkVmZyP-emRsK5qAXXIvtuO/view?usp=sharing (vite and react router, without them nothing would work)

Unzip it. After put unzipped folder into the Navigation - router folder.

Open PowerShell, put address to navigation folder. (It could be like this: '  cd "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Practice sites\React framework\React-Learning\Navigation-router"   ', cd = path to folder)

After just input npm run dev , and everything should be working, if not please get help from Ai or whatever.

# Old requirements (still working though)
every folder require vite, but bcs there's too many files in vite's folder, github don't wanna download them.

So as a solution https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sWbjYYMoFB7FUTR1k3Pkkol3EqvtLuoK/view?usp=sharing , i downloaded RAR file ay my disk

So you just have to download any folder, and unzip node_modules.rar to folder, and drag it to any folder (like first-react-site or others).


It would be like that

node_modules (folder) 

public (folder)

src (folder)

.gitignore (txt)

eslint.config.js (file)

index.html (file)

packages.json (file)

package-lock.json(file)

readme.md(file)

vite.config.js(file)
